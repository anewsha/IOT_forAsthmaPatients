# Environment monitoring for Asthma Patients
----
My classmates and I are worked on an IoT domain Analyst project. We wanted to learn and apply our knowledge to help society with a healthcare topic using ThingSpeak, ESP32, and basic ML models

Note: Create your channel on thingspeak and use your API key and channelID. You can enter this information in api.py

- Air quality refers to the composition of gases and particles present in the atmosphere, which can vary based on factors such as industrial activities, transportation, and natural
processes.
- Key pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, Carbon monoxide and PM2.5
